## Web Application

This web application is not intended to serve as a production-ready, deployable application, rather it demonstrates how a simple, lightweight web app can be built and bundled up for download by the Notecard-enabled Raspberry Pi. 

It will also show how Notehub environment variables can initiate fresh code downloads, or affect already downloaded web apps on the Raspberry Pi eliminating the need to download new code for minor modifications.
